# wutworld-bot

<h3> The earliest and one of the only Applab bots in <span><a href="https://studio.code.org/">Code.org</a></span>.</h3>
Proof of concept that bots and backend servers can respond to record updates in Applab; the most effective way we can send data from a backend.


## Update 3/1/2023
Wut World (and all of the original creator's projects) have been taken down. The idea is still there and works, but not with this specific project.
